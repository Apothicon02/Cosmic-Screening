# Cosmic Screening

Cosmic Screeing is a mod that takes screenshots every time you leave your world. These screenshots are permanently stored in your screenshots folder, while the latest one is repeatedly overriden in a "cosmic-screening" folder adjacent to the screenshots folder every time you leave a world.

Potential Uses: 
- Automatic forming of images needed to compose timelapses in the form of the screenshots folder. 
- Using the latest image as the background in a launcher.
